# My Very First Web Page

Welcome to my very first web page.

This page was created using HTML & CSS.
An online IDE called Gitpod was used to create the Web page. The project was deployed using Gitpages on Github.

## Languages And Technologies Used
### HTML - Hypertext Markup language
HTML is the foundation for every web application ever written. It is the standard markup language for Web pages. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. HTML elements are represented by <> tags.
HTML is the structure & contents of our web pages including text & images. 

### CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML & JavaScript. CSS is made up of rules which are used to to add style to our Web page. CSS is designed to enable the seperation of presentation and content, including layout, colors and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presenation characteristics.

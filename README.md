# My Very First Web Page

Welcome to my very first web page.

This page was created using *HTML* & *CSS*.
An online IDE called *Gitpod* was used to create the Web page. The project was deployed using *Github Pages* on a platform called *Github*.

## Languages And Technologies
### HTML - Hypertext Markup language
HTML is the foundation for every web application ever written. It is the standard markup language for Web pages. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. HTML elements are represented by <> tags.
HTML is the structure & contents of our web pages including text & images. 

### CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML & JavaScript. CSS is made up of rules which are used to to add style to our Web page. CSS is designed to enable the seperation of presentation and content, including layout, colors and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presenation characteristics.

### Gitpod
Gitpod is an *Integrated Development Environment* - IDE, also called an editor. Gitpod is a cloud-based editor, which means that we can do all our development work in the browser. We use an IDE to manage our files. It allows use to create and edit or modify our files and also to run a preview of our code.

### Github 
Github is an industry-standard web platform for developers. It allows us to keep an accurate version history of our code and also to share it with others.

### Github Pages
Github Pages allows us to deploy our website within Github. 

## Rationale
The rationale of this project was to gain a better understanding of how to use HTML and CSS and how they work together to build, design and style a web page. It introduced us to Gitpod and the *Command-line Interface* or CLI which allows us to view files and folders, create files and directories, edit, copy, move and delete files and also run programs without a *Graphical User Interface* or GUI but by using a tool called the *Terminal*. It also introduced us to the **_git add_**, **_git commit_** and **_git push_** commands which allow us to push our files to our remote repository Github.
